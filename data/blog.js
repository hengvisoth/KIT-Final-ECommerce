        title : "Nike has carefully positioned the Dunk to be 2021's hottest sneaker",
        article : `Nike is always in the middle of a balancing act. It’s both the world’s biggest footwear company, selling several million pairs of shoes annually, and an ultra-exclusive designer, making some of the most sought-after, hardest-to-get sneakers on the market.
        The two states are related. Nike’s limited-edition shoes help it maintain an aura of cool, decade after decade. That helps it sell a lot of products, a necessity to be as big as Nike. But economists and marketers alike have long recognized that scarcity breeds desire. Oversaturate the market and you can hurt demand. Nike has to be big and small at the same time.
        Preserving this equilibrium is one of the trickier acts in the world of fashion and footwear. Over the years, Nike has become adept at managing its distribution to maintain this balance, and if you know where to look, you can see it happening in real-time. Right now, it’s playing out with the Nike Dunk.
        Originally introduced in 1985, the Dunk is one of Nike’s stalwart styles and a long-running favorite of sneaker obsessives. In recent years, it hasn’t been a big seller in terms of volume, but in 2019 Nike started building demand for the shoe with a number of limited releases that left shoppers eager for more. In 2020, it ramped up its output of exclusive styles and collaborations with sneaker shops, designers, and musicians, including partners ranging from rapper Travis Scott to grizzled rock veterans the Grateful Dead.
        In 2021 it plans to cash in, as it pushes the Dunk to an even wider audience.

        title : `Nike Officially Announces G-Dragon's PEACEMINUSONE x AF1 "Para-Noise 2.0"`,
        article : `Following a series of leaks and rumors, Nike (NYSE:NKE -1.12%) has finally officially announced G-Dragon‘s PEACEMINUSONE x Nike Air Force 1 “Para-Noise 2.0” collaboration. Serving as the sequel to the BIGBANG leader’s first “Para-Noise” collaboration with the sportswear giant, the upcoming release once again builds on the South Korean artist’s favorite silhouette matched with his belief in creative exchange of ideas to a design fabricated to shift with the wearer. 
        The PEACEMINUSONE x AF1 “Para-Noise 2.0” reverses the color scheme with a focus on a clean white tone while retaining the self-expressive character of its predecessor. The design theme reflects G-Dragon’s views on self-actualization as a way through challenging times, a mindset he calls “YOUTOPIA.”       
        “Even though everything is uncertain these days, we shouldn’t stop expressing ourselves as the way we are, and creating our own world,” says G-DRAGON. “With these footsteps being connected, we will find our utopia spreading in front of our eyes. I dream of every one of you expressing yourselves freely in the Youtopia that you create for yourselves.”        
        The shoe features a white-tone painted premium leather upper that peels-away revealing an original artwork once again inspired by G-Dragon’s sense of optimism towards art as a form of self-expression for youth around the world to be unified through collective creativity. The shoe also features contrasting black tumbled leather Swoosh branding and black embroidered daisy motifs at the tongue, eyelet pins and branded thick laces. Rounding up the design of the collaboration is a matching white lining, printed insoles and a white AF1 sole unit dressed all over with haphazardly applied strokes of black paint. Each shoe will also come in special packaging that continues the design of the collaboration. 
        G-Dragon’s PEACEMINUSONE x Nike Air Force 1 “Para-Noise 2.0” collaboration is set to release globally November 25.

        title : `DIOR IS A LITTLE BETTER WITH JISOO`,
        article : `By now, the members of BLACKPINK have the fashion industry in a chokehold.

        If you've been on the internet, you'll know that the K-pop fandom is one of the biggest and loudest online, and when it comes to BLACKPINK, brands have figured out how to harness the energy and excitement felt by fans to create fun campaigns starring each of the members.
        Jisoo has been an ambassador for Dior for a while now, frequently starring in the label's beauty campaigns and attending its fashion shows in Paris and across the world.
        For Spring/Summer 2022, she fronts the campaign wearing Maria Grazia Chiuri's designs, which include a yellow skirt with a matching blazer, paired with a Lady Dior bag, as well as a quilted vest, a strappy little black dress, and more.`,

        title : `How Blackpink’s Jennie Stole the Show in Chanel's Front Row`,
        article : ` As Paris Fashion Week’s hottest ticket, Chanel never fails to bring out the stars. Just as founder Coco filled her salons with a who’s who of European high society, her namesake brand populates its front row with an international roster of ambassadors who represent the best of art and entertainment. Virginie Viard’s fall 2022’s collection debuted to a packed house, but one guest stood out from the rest: South Korean singer Jennie, 1/4th of the K-Pop girl group Blackpink.


        The show’s scene-stealer, Jennie enjoyed her time in the front row from the moment she arrived at the Grand Palais Éphémère in a gamine look from Viard’s pre-fall runway. Despite the attention from paparazzi and the fans camped out to catch a glimpse of her, she focused on fashion. “Coming to Chanel is the best [and] it’s always great to see a new collection,” she says. “Each one gives me different insights and inspirations but this show was purely amazing!”
        
        A Chanel ambassador since 2017, Jennie is familiar with the house’s signatures, and Viard’s use of the brand’s iconic textiles struck a chord this season. “What captivated me was the focus was on tweed,” she explains. “All the looks were over-the-top sophistication, but my favorites were tweed looks with delicate details and colors.” Pieces like the intricately woven pastel coat worn by show opener Vivienne Rohner and the strapless cocktail-length checked gown on model Fran Summers were impossible to ignore. Still, Jennie was equally impressed by how the material transformed the set-pieces inside the Grand Palais. “Even the venue itself was decorated with tweed,” she says. “It was quite remarkable.”
        
        
        Having worn multiple variations of Chanel’s little black jackets and classic suits, Jennie wanted to try something different for Tuesday’s show. Settling on an embroidered velvet blouson and matching skirt from Viard’s pre-fall collection worn with diamond and 18k gold Coco crush rings, she looked the part of designer muse. Still, the star’s trip wasn’t solely about fashion week. Like many, Jennie finds people-watching the best part of the Parisian experience. “I like to just stroll around the neighborhoods and explore new spots,” she says. “[When I’m free] I just walk in the park [or] look at the people in the streets and listen to a few good songs.”`,

        title : `BLACKPINK'S LISA MAKES HER RUNWAY DEBUT AT CELINE`,
        article : `She's been a brand ambassador since 2019, but this is her first time appearing in a runway presentation for the French fashion house.


        It's Lalisa's world, and we're just living in it.
        On Friday, Celine released a short film directed by Hedi Slimane to debut its Summer 2022 collection, title "Baie des Anges." In lieu of walking down a traditional runway, models make their way through various iconic locations in Nice — down the Promenade des Anglais, around the Astronomical Observatory and outside the historic Le Negresco hotel and the Villa Masséna. The French fashion house also invited some of Slimane's muses to be a part of the cast: Kaia Gerber, Suzanne Lindon, Diana Silvers and Lalisa Manobal, a.k.a. Lisa, the Thai superstar known for performing one fourth of Blackpink, for her recent solo singles, "Lalisa" and "Money," and, among other things, for being incredibly stylish.   
        Lisa has been a Celine ambassador for ready-to-wear and accessories since 2019, and is a regular at the brand's Paris Fashion Week shows (though, she skipped the most recent season). Just this week, she was announced as the face of Celine's Haute Parfumerie, too. So what better time to make her runway debut? `,
